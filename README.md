# **NYC Food Delivery Data Analysis**

### **Context**

The number of restaurants in New York is increasing day by day. Lots of students and busy professionals rely on those restaurants due to their hectic lifestyles. Online food delivery service is a great option for them. It provides them with good food from their favorite restaurants. A food aggregator company FoodHub offers access to multiple restaurants through a single smartphone app.

The app allows the restaurants to receive a direct online order from a customer. The app assigns a delivery person from the company to pick up the order after it is confirmed by the restaurant. The delivery person then uses the map to reach the restaurant and waits for the food package. Once the food package is handed over to the delivery person, he/she confirms the pick-up in the app and travels to the customer's location to deliver the food. The delivery person confirms the drop-off in the app after delivering the food package to the customer. The customer can rate the order in the app. The food aggregator earns money by collecting a fixed margin of the delivery order from the restaurants.

### **Objective**

The food aggregator company has stored the data of the different orders made by the registered customers in their online portal. They want to analyze the data to get a fair idea about the demand of different restaurants which will help them in enhancing their customer experience. Suppose you are hired as a Data Scientist in this company and the Data Science team has shared some of the key questions that need to be answered. Perform the data analysis to find answers to these questions that will help the company to improve the business.


### Conclusions:

The data provided was very helpful in drawing very important conclusions on the ordering habits of the customers located in the delivery area, which can ultimately lead to increased net revenue.  There are three main areas that can easily be addressed to increase profits quickly with little cost to Food Hub.  Customer cuisine and restaurant preferences, ratings, and possibly weekend or weekday orders.
*   Customer preference for cuisine and at specific restaurants is strongly represented in this data.  American, Japanese, Italian, and Chinese are the clear favorites.  This is also represented in the local restaurant population. This is a great area to focus on for promotions.
*   Ratings are important for customer decision making, higher ratings can alter choices about restaurant selection.  There are a significant number of orders not being rated at 38%. This is a great area to focus on for incentives.
*   The difference in the number of orders placed on the weekend versus the weekday is very interesting.  With minimal additional information from Food Hub there could be promotions and incentives to boost orders on either time of the week.

### Recommendations:

###  Restaurant promotions:
*   As the data suggest there are a number of large order count restaurants represented in the data analysis that would be great to approach for promotional offers through Food Hub.  
###   Ideal promotions:
            *   Incentivize orders over 20 dollars
            *   Order x number of times results in rebate or free items
        *   Where to start?
            *   Prioritize high volume large order count restaurants.  These venues can handle the increased volume.
            *   Secondarily make contact with smaller, lesser-known venues, promote the value in 'free advertising'.
###  Increase Ratings:
    *   In order to increase order ratings a two-part method could be used.
        *   Create an in-app reminder for a rating after delivery.  
            *   Pull the data in x amount of time to see if this increased ratings, or alternatively if this method is already being utilized:
            *   Incentivize the ratings
                *   x amount of next order
                *   x value after x number (ie: 5) ratings have been completed.
###  Weekday / Weekend order volume increase:
    *   In order to maximize this increase revenue path, further data will need to be reviewed.
        *   The time the orders are placed will indicate what the distribution is and would dictate better recommendations.
            * Ultimately the goal is to incentive low order volume times to increase revenue.  
                *   Restaurant specials that are time based: Breakfast, brunch, lunch, or dinner specials   
        *   Delivery driver availability, what are the number of drivers on weekdays versus weekends.      
            *  For times of low driver pool: incentivize driver by increasing delivery fee percentage.

In closing, the purpose of the data to increase net revenue, which is done by more orders at a higher order cost, and with a few well placed promotions and incentives this is more than attainable, additionally with a quick return and small investment of time.  Making contact with restaurants, small in app rating incentives, and continued monitoring what the data shows, increased per order profit and order volume will follow.
